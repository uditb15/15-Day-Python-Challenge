## You are a Product Analyst for the Lululemon Online Store team investigating how alternative payment methods might influence sales performance. The team wants to understand the potential impact of introducing a new installment payment option. Your analysis will predict sales lift and customer conversion for the proposed payment method

### Question 1

Between April 1st and June 30th, 2025, what is the count of transactions for each payment method? This analysis will establish the baseline distribution of how customers currently pay.

### Question 2

Between April 1st and June 30th, 2025, what is the average order value for each payment method? This metric will help us assess which payment methods are tied to higher spending levels.

### Question 3

Between April 1st and June 30th, 2025, what would be the predicted sales lift if a "pay over time" option were introduced? Assume that 20% of customers using credit cards switch to this option and that their average order value increases by 15%. This calculation will directly inform the expected impact on overall sales performance.
